# PaymentContext - NetCore
A project (POC) to understand how rich domains works

###ðŸ“–Introduction

PaymentContext is a proof of concept to create a context of payment using researchs like OOP, DDD AND CQRS.

To introduce yoursef into this concepts i'll explain them better.

`OOP - Object Oriented Programming` 
 This concept is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures.
 
`DDD - Domain Driven Design`
 This concept is a set of principles and practices to solve some developed problems and to improve the development process.This concepts could be 
approached better by reading the book " Implementing Domain-Driven Design - Vaughn Vernon"

`CQRS - Command Query Responsibility`
This concept ask that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller but not both. In other words, asking a question should not change the answer.

Obviosly that explanation don't make you understand every thing about this concepts. To improve your knowledge about, i recommended you read some books like this one that i recommended above. I'm doing that!
