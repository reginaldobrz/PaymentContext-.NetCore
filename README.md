# A project (POC) to understand how rich domains works developing a payment context using .NetCore, The goal is reuse this project and modifying according to the project but obeying the architecture

## üìñIntroduction

PaymentContext is a proof of concept to create a context of payment using researchs like OOP, DDD AND CQRS.

To introduce yoursef into this concepts i'll explain them better.

````
OOP - Object Oriented Programming
```` 
 * This concept is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures.
 
````
DDD - Domain Driven Design
````
 * This concept is a set of principles and practices to solve some developed problems and to improve the development process.This concepts could be approached better by reading the book " Implementing Domain-Driven Design - Vaughn Vernon"

````
CQRS - Command Query Responsibility
````
* This concept ask that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller but not both. In other words, asking a question should not change the answer.

Obviosly that explanation don't make you understand every thing about this concepts. To improve your knowledge about, i recommended you read some books like this one that i recommended above. I'm doing that! 

## üíªConcepts
To do this "POC" i followed some steps, and i will told you every single one to you!

* `Ubiquitous Language`
* `Rich Domains vs Anemic Domain`
* `Sub Domains`
* `Context and Domain Separation`
* `Entities`
* `SOLID and Clean Code`
* `Primitive Obssession`
* `Value Objects`
* `Validations`
* `Design By Contracts`
* `Commands`
* `Fail Fast Validation`
* `Testing`
